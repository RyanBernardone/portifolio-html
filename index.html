        <h3>Movie Ranking Webpage</h3>

        <h3>Birthday Invitation</h3>
        <p>This one was the most fun to made. I had a lot of fun making this webpage because we started to use links and lists to build it.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately i can't show you guys my version of the page, because it was a little offensive. I made it as a joke to me and my friends laugh at.</p>
        <p>So instead of my page i put Dr. Yu's page for you guys to see. It was basicaly that but with memes... Lots of memes.</p>
